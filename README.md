## ![Arduino Web Power Distributer](https://github.com/Gfast2/Arduino_Ethernetshield_Web_Power_Distributer/blob/master/icon.png) Arduino Ethernet shield Web Power Distributer


This Programm let a Arduino Uno with its Ethernet Shield control a [IP Switch](http://www.junghanns.net/en/ip_switch_produkt.html) through TCP/IP protocal. 


When Arduino communicate with the web server which build into the power distributer, Arduino act as a web client. Meanwhile there is a web server that is hosted in Arduino directely. It is used to set the parameters of the main programm that is running on the Arduino. In this scene the Arduino act as webserver.
